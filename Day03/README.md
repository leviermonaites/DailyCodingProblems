# HELPER

Hello there, good to see you again!

So, today we have a code, that I think can't be called as a challenge, but it was too easy to accomplish!
But, it was easy only because javaScript already do the work for ourselves.
I made this version of the code in javaScript code, but I plan in this weekend to do one code, that was built for me.
So probably I'll use a string builder and so on...

But, if you didn't understand the purpose of the challenge, let me try to explain to you.

We all use JSON methods often in javaScript, but what if we haven't these methods?
It's exactly what this challenge try to convey for us.
So, we would have to write down these codes with our own hands.
It's just that!!
