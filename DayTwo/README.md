Okay, there's not so much to explain, but just to be clear, I wanna explain a little bit the map method that I called.

At every loop that it makes - each loop run after the "for loop" is completed, that's why the algorith has a Big O Notation of O(nÂ²) - it creates a let called "productOfAllNumbers" and then the "for loop" when executed will change the value of this variable according to what was asked, that was:

    -   The total product of all numbers in the array, but punting on current value.
