# HELPER

Hello there guys, one more once I'm here with a code challenge that I've done to show for you.
Today, code challenge was too easy, but it was just too easy, if I've actually done it right.
I've never saw this concept of cars, car, and cdr before, but then, I just made some quick searches, and learned one thing here and there to be able to do the code.
I don't know if it's actually right, either the pair should be an object, or the class Cons should be a separated function and the same for car and cdr methods.

So, the code is explaining itself this time, I don't think we need an explanation for it, but if you have doubts, tell me please!
I plan in the future learn more about this "cons" and its concepts, because now I'm actually focusing more on DataStructures!
